# LJ Code201 day 19

Today I learned a little bit local storage and how to we were able to transfer our high scores on the the score 
board to our guessing states game. Also had some issues with linking our custom Pacman font on to live gh page. 
Apperantly hosting the font wasn't gonna work ether. So we just used images of our title to display on the broswer 
instead of the actual font.
