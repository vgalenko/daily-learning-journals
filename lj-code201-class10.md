# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

For the past two days we learned little more about the DOM and HTML minipulation. I really enjoyed learning about addEventListener function 
and how it pretty much waits for an even to happen so it can then do its task. As I am still learning about the DOM but so far what I've learned 
has been very interesting. Also learned a few CSS tricks by creating animations without using JS.
