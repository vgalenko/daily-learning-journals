# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Today I learned about objects literal and how to structure them properly. Also learned that
functions inside objects are called methods. Used objects literal to work on our salmon
cookie project, the hardest thing to solve was how to combine objects, for loops, array and
functions all in one block of code. Also that its always preferred to use variables inside functions
if possible because the pages load faster if they are local scopes.

DOM was introduced to class for the first time, it was easy to understand at first then it became
more complex and I got lost.
