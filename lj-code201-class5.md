# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

One of the few things that I learned last couple of days was how to merge branches
in git hub to the master branch. As well as some intro to functions. I completely understood
the simple syntax of functions. One of the most challenging things for me to understand
is how do two or three functions function (work) when they are combined together. Simply can't understand.
A lot was covered in the last two days but didn't learn much because its not clicking fully!
